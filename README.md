# Electives-advisory-system

An electives advisory / prediction system in Prolog for BTech or MTech student of IIITD. It needs to advise a student on what electives to take given the career they want to pursue and the pre-requisites that they have done.

<br>

Advisory system here refers to a system that will take some inputs from the student and
ask further questions to narrow down choices and then suggest to the student the
appropriate electives. Prediction system here refers to a system that will take all inputs
and then suggest to the student a list of choices with some ranking.

This is done in __Prolog__.
